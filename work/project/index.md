# Project

In this project, you can build whatever you want and you can use any library, framework, tool and programming language of your choice. However, your project must contain two distinct pieces: 

- a frontend UI that works relatively well on the commonly used web browsers
- a web API that follows the REST design principles and that is completely independent from the frontend 

By the end of the semester, your app must be online and usable by the course staff. 

## Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project must be written exclusively by the team members. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web must be clearly cited in the credit page of the application. 

The team members have the freedom to build whatever they want as a project, however the following restrictions strictly apply: 

1. the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that was developed outside of the scope of this course
1. the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another paid work
1. the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another course deliverable

All team members will be held accountable in case of violation of the policy stated here. 

### Marking 

The grading rubric is decomposed as follows: 

- **Team registration and project proposal:** 10%
- **Beta version:** 10%
- **Final version:** 70%
- **Documentation and presentation:** 10%

## Deliverables

### Team registration and project proposal

After registration, each tam will be assigned a new private Github repository for the project. By the project proposal deadline, the tam should have pushed the proposal to their project repository. The proposal will take the form of a `README.md` file at the root of your project repository on Github. This file should be properly formatted in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 

To receive full credits, the proposal should contains the following information: 

- project Title
- team Members
- a description of web application
- a description of the key features that will be completed by the Beta version
- a description of additional features that will be complete by the Final version
- a description of the technology that you will use
- a description of the technical challenges

### Beta Version

By the beta version deadline, your team should have:

1. pushed the beta version to the project repository on Github
2. scheduled a 20min meeting to demo and discuss the beta version. 

The meeting with the TA must be scheduled before the deadline but it can take place after the deadline. To receive full credits, your team should demonstrate that the key features of your application work. 

### Final Version

By the final version deadline, your team should have: 

1. pushed the final version to the project repository on Github
3. deployed the application and provide its public URL in the `README.md` file

Since every project is unique, grading is subjective. While evaluating the application, the course staff will take into considerations:

- is the idea interesting, challenging and substantial?
- is the user interface intuitive and appealing?
- is the application working well?
- is the application secured? 
- is it well implemented?
- is the code well organized?
- does it covers the concepts seen in class correctly?

### Documentation and presentation

Before your presentation, your team should have updated the application with its documentation. For each API method, the documentation should detail:
  
1. Description: a description of the method
1. Request: HTTP method (either POST, PUT, GET, PATCH or DELETE) and URL   
    - content-type: [optional] the [type of](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) the request body (by default it is raw text)
    - body: [optional] a precise description of the body
1. Response(s): the [HTTP status code](http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)
    - content-type: [optional] the [type of](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) the response body (by default it is raw text)
    - body: [optional] a precise description of the body
1. Example: aan example of such an API query using `curl`
